This is my solution to Homework 2.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

# Question 1
Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet.
(1) Specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries;
(2) Use reasonable variable names;
(3) Omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data;
(4) Round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converts the result to an integer variable.
```{r readnclean_data}
trashwheel_df = 
	read_xlsx(
		"./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
		sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
		range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
	janitor::clean_names() %>% 
	drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
	mutate(
		sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
		sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
	)
```
